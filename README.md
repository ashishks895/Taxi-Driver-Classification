# Taxi-Driver-Classification
Taxi Trajectory Classification using Deep Learning

The goal of this project is to classify taxi drivers based on their driving patterns using trajectory data. 
This classification is essential for various applications, such as driver behavior analysis, anomaly detection, and personalized services. 
We propose a methodology for processing the data, generating relevant features, designing neural network structures, and evaluating the 
models. 
We aim to achieve a classification accuracy of at least 60%.
